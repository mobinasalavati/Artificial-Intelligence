    "Gandalf the Grey is tasked with leading and guiding the Fellowship of the Ring to confront the Dark Lord Sauron. For this purpose, he must guide the Fellowship members through the orcs (Sauron's army) and deliver each to a specific position, finally reaching Gondor himself. Gandalf has a chess-like map that includes the following:\n",
    "+ Gandalf's starting point\n",
    "+ Position of each Fellowship member\n",
    "+ Position of orcs\n",
    "+ Location where each Fellowship member should be placed\n",
    "+ Final position (Gondor)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each orc has a military rank that determines their surveillance range using Manhattan distance n, where Gandalf and Fellowship members cannot pass through. Since Gandalf moves at night when orcs are asleep, he can pass through surveilled cells without waking them, but only for n moves within their surveillance area. After n moves in an orc's surveillance area, they wake up. After leaving an orc's surveillance area, you can return to that area without considering previous moves."

    "First, we introduce the defined heuristics:\n",
    "+ h1: Number of remaining Fellowship members who have not yet reached their correct location\n",
    "+ h2: Manhattan distance from Gandalf to the nearest Fellowship member on the chess board who has not yet gone to their correct location\n",
    "+ h3: Euclidean distance to the nearest Fellowship member on the chess board who has not yet gone to their correct location\n",
    "\n",
    "All three defined heuristics are admissible because for each node, the distance to reach the goal state has a greater (or equal) value compared to h1, h2, or h3.\n",
    "h1 is a consistent function because in the path to reach the goal state, the value g(n) + h(n) = f(n) has a non-decreasing value for all nodes, as g(n) increases by at most one and h(n) decreases by at most one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we explain the algorithms. In A* algorithm, nodes are first entered into a priority queue and then sorted in ascending order of f(n) value for all nodes, and then expanded in FIFO manner. The value f(n) in each node equals g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the actual cost from initial state to that node and h(n) is the estimated distance from this node to goal state.\n",
    "If the value h(n) for each node in A* algorithm execution is multiplied by a constant alpha, this algorithm becomes weighted A* algorithm. Due to multiplying a value by the heuristic for each node, the admissibility of the heuristic may be lost and the final solution of the algorithm may not be optimal."
