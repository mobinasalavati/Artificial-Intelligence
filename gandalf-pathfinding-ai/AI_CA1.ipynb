    "\n",
    "Gandalf the Grey is tasked with leading and guiding the Fellowship of the Ring to confront the Dark Lord Sauron. For this purpose, he must guide the Fellowship members through the orcs (Sauron's army) and deliver each to a specific position, finally reaching Gondor himself. Gandalf has a chess-like map that includes the following:\n",
    "- Gandalf's starting point\n",
    "- Position of each Fellowship member\n",
    "- Position of orcs\n",
    "- Location where each Fellowship member should be placed\n",
    "- Final position (Gondor)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each orc has a military rank that determines their surveillance range using Manhattan distance n, where Gandalf and Fellowship members cannot pass through. Since Gandalf moves at night when orcs are asleep, he can pass through surveilled cells without waking them, but only for n moves within their surveillance area. After n moves in an orc's surveillance area, they wake up. After leaving an orc's surveillance area, you can return to that area without considering previous moves."

    "- Lines 2-3: Coordinates of start and end points respectively (row number from top, then column number from left)\n",
    "- Line 4: k and l, where k is the number of orcs and l is the number of Fellowship members\n",
    "- Next k lines: x, y, and c, where x is row number, y is column number, and c is the orc's military rank or Manhattan surveillance distance\n",
    "- Next l lines: Current locations of Fellowship members in order\n",
    "- Next l lines: Designated locations where Fellowship members should be placed in the same order. Note that each Fellowship member must be placed in a specific location, meaning the i-th Fellowship member must be placed in the i-th location."
